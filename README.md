# HIRNN
The Hydro-Integrated Recurrent Neural Network (HIRNN) model operates at daily timesteps and is designed to predict streamflow. The model requires dynamic inputs such as precipitation (rain) and potential evapotranspiration. For managed catchments, it also requires static variables, including the active storage capacity of reservoirs and the area ratio (the ratio of the reservoir catchment area to the total catchment area). The HIRNN model is versatile and can be applied to various catchment types, including unmanaged perennial (UP), unmanaged intermittent (UI), managed perennial (MP), and managed intermittent (MI) catchments. Additionally, it generates various intermediate variables, such as soil moisture and groundwater storage, due to its interpretable model structure.
